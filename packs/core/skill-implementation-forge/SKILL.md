# skill-implementation-forge

## Purpose

Use this skill to implement or refactor one named skill from an approved contract artifact.

This skill owns the implementation phase only. It does not define the contract, does not author downstream eval suites, and does not change eval/runtime architecture.

## Phase objective

The objective of this phase is to materialize one named skill from an approved contract artifact without renegotiating the contract.

## Use this skill when

Use this skill when:
- the target skill already has an approved contract artifact
- that contract artifact is provided in an operationally inspectable form, such as an exact repo-local path or `file://` reference
- the task is to implement or refactor the skill from that contract
- the work can stay within one named skill
- downstream eval work, if mentioned, is explicitly deferred

## Do not use this skill when

Do not use this skill for:
- defining, rewriting, or tightening the contract
- downstream eval authoring
- eval/runtime architecture changes
- provider, fixture, generated-output, or shared-runner changes
- repo-wide policy or unrelated tooling refactors
- requests that mix implementation with contract authoring or eval authoring in one inseparable pass

## Inputs

The request must provide:
- one approved contract artifact for exactly one target skill
- a clearly identified target skill name

For this phase, an approved contract artifact is operationally inspectable only when it is identified concretely enough to open as authority, such as by an exact repo-local path, a `file://` reference, or another uniquely resolvable artifact. Conversational references such as `the approved brief`, `the frozen contract`, or `the contract we discussed` are not enough.

When a request says an approved contract artifact exists but does not provide an operationally inspectable locator, stop and ask. Do not substitute the current forge skill prompt, a nearby repo artifact, or a guessed repo-default path as the missing contract authority.

For implementation closure in this repo, that approved contract artifact must freeze the canonical `skill.name` and `skill.description` that downstream `SKILL.md` frontmatter needs. If either field is missing from the contract authority, stop and ask rather than reconstructing metadata from the current repository state or conversational context.

Treat that approved contract artifact as the sole required contractual handoff from the contract phase. Do not require auxiliary repo-local authoring refs just because they were consulted while the brief was created.

For repo-native contracts authored after package-shape hardening, the approved contract artifact should also freeze `authoring.packageShape.requiredFiles` and `authoring.packageShape.supportFolders`. If a legacy approved contract predates that shape and omits `authoring.packageShape`, stay conservative: default to `SKILL.md` only and do not infer extra support folders from repo habits.

If `authoring.packageShape.supportFolders` includes `agents`, the approved contract artifact must also freeze `authoring.interface.display_name`, `authoring.interface.short_description`, and `authoring.interface.default_prompt`. If that interface authority is missing, stop and ask rather than inventing metadata for `agents/openai.yaml`.

Useful supporting inputs may include:
- an existing implementation of the target skill
- repository source-of-truth context when the approved contract artifact or the implementation task actually depends on it:
  - `README.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `packs/core/skill-contract-forge/SKILL.md`
- repository docs explicitly referenced by the approved contract artifact
- current official external docs only when the approved contract artifact or the requested implementation explicitly depends on them

Those materials are supportive context, not extra required handoff authority. If the approved contract distilled their effect already, do not reopen them as a hidden precondition.

## Outputs

Produce:
- one implemented or refactored shallow skill package for the named target skill
- `SKILL.md` for the target skill
- nearby `references/`, `assets/`, `agents/`, or `scripts/` only when the approved contract artifact explicitly requires them through `authoring.packageShape`
- `agents/openai.yaml` only when the approved contract artifact explicitly requires `agents` and also freezes the needed `authoring.interface`

When the approved contract artifact freezes durable examples, templates, or long reference content through `authoring.packageShape`, materialize that content into the target package instead of leaving the implementation dependent on upstream local authoring paths.

The exact terminal marker is:

`Skill implementation ready`

## Stop-and-ask conditions

Stop and ask when:
- the approved contract artifact is missing
- the approved contract artifact is only mentioned, not provided in an operationally inspectable form
- the contract is ambiguous or not specific enough to implement safely
- the approved contract artifact does not freeze canonical `skill.name` and `skill.description`
- the approved contract artifact requires `agents` in `authoring.packageShape.supportFolders` but omits `authoring.interface`
- the target skill is not clearly identified
- the request mixes implementation with contract authoring in one inseparable pass
- the request mixes implementation with downstream eval authoring in one inseparable pass
- the request widens into eval/runtime architecture or shared eval infrastructure

These prompts are insufficient on their own:
- `implement this skill`
- `refactor this skill`
- `rewrite the current skill`
- `build the next skill`

The existence of a contract artifact is not enough by itself.
If the artifact does not freeze the single job, target skill, outputs, or stop conditions clearly enough to guide implementation, stop and ask rather than filling the gaps from intuition.

Use `non-trigger` when the primary job is no longer implementation-from-contract for one named skill, even if the prompt mentions implementation secondarily. Use `stop-and-ask` only when the core job is still implementation but a material precondition is missing or the request widens inseparably.

## Procedure

1. Confirm that the task is implementation-from-contract for one named skill.
2. Confirm that the approved contract artifact freezes canonical `skill.name` and `skill.description` for the target skill; if not, stop and ask.
3. Confirm whether the approved contract artifact freezes `authoring.packageShape`. If it does, treat that shape as the authority for support folders. If it does not, use the conservative legacy fallback of `SKILL.md` only.
4. If `authoring.packageShape.supportFolders` includes `agents`, confirm that the same contract artifact also freezes `authoring.interface.display_name`, `authoring.interface.short_description`, and `authoring.interface.default_prompt`; if not, stop and ask.
5. Inspect the current target state, if any.
6. Create or refactor `SKILL.md` as the core implementation surface.
7. Preserve conditional contract semantics in the implementation. If the approved contract says to use repo conventions or `AGENTS.md` only when present, or to fall back to a default path only when no repo-local convention exists, keep that conditional behavior instead of flattening it into an unconditional input, rule, or path.
8. Add only the support files and folders the approved contract artifact requires. Do not widen beyond `requiredFiles` and `supportFolders`, do not create empty support folders, and do not treat auxiliary local authoring refs as hidden required outputs.
9. When support folders are required, keep support content in the nearest justified folder instead of leaving a monolithic `SKILL.md`.
10. Keep the implementation aligned with the approved contract artifact.
11. Before finalizing, check that the resulting skill still has one clear job, explicit inputs and outputs, strong stop-and-ask behavior, nearby negative examples, relevant edge cases, and the smallest justified package shape.
12. Run `npm run validate:skill-metadata` before closure.
13. Stop at the exact terminal marker `Skill implementation ready`.

## Guardrails

- Do not redefine, tighten, or renegotiate the contract during implementation.
- Do not author downstream eval suites.
- Do not change eval/runtime architecture, providers, fixtures, generated outputs, or shared runner structure.
- Do not widen into repo-wide policy changes or unrelated tooling refactors.
- Do not infer a missing target skill from deictic phrases such as `this skill`, `the current skill`, or `the next skill`.
- If downstream eval work is mentioned but explicitly deferred, remain in implementation scope and defer that later work.
- If the approved contract artifact conflicts with the current implementation, implement from the approved contract artifact rather than silently redefining it.
- If a request only mentions that an approved contract artifact exists, do not substitute another artifact from surrounding context just to keep moving. Stop and ask for the inspectable authority instead.
- Do not infer missing frontmatter metadata from repo state, file names, or conversational hints when the approved contract artifact omits canonical `skill.description`.
- Keep the package shallow by default.
- Do not infer extra support folders when a legacy approved contract omits `authoring.packageShape`; default to `SKILL.md` only.
- Do not create empty support folders or broader scaffolding than the approved contract artifact requires.
- Do not materialize `agents/openai.yaml` unless the approved contract artifact explicitly requires `agents` and freezes the corresponding `authoring.interface`.
- Do not leave long reference, script, or template content duplicated in `SKILL.md` when the approved contract artifact already requires a dedicated support folder for it.
- Do not require or preserve auxiliary local authoring refs as implementation authority when the approved contract artifact already carries the needed boundary.
- Do not turn optional context such as `AGENTS.md`, repo conventions, or official external docs into mandatory inputs or always-on rules unless the approved contract artifact makes them materially mandatory.
- Do not collapse conditional path rules like “use the repo-local planning location when defined, otherwise fall back to `plans/<request-slug>.plan.md`” into a hardcoded default path unless the approved contract artifact freezes that exact unconditional path.
- Do not invent repo-default behavior that the approved contract artifact did not actually ground.
- Do not adopt `Classification:` or `Workflow:` response headers by imitation of another forge skill.
- Do not end a non-trigger or stop-and-ask response with `Skill implementation ready`.

## Examples

In scope:
- “Implement the new skill from this approved contract artifact, which already freezes `skill.name` and `skill.description`, run `npm run validate:skill-metadata`, and stop at `Skill implementation ready`.”
- “Refactor one named skill from its approved contract artifact without touching downstream evals.”
- “The current implementation and the approved contract differ; align the skill to the approved contract and stop at `Skill implementation ready`.”
- “Implement the skill from this approved contract artifact, which already freezes `authoring.packageShape` and requires `references/` but no broader scaffold.”

Stop and ask:
- “Implement this skill so it is cleaner and more complete.”
- “Implement `example-skill` from the approved brief I mentioned earlier,” when that brief is not actually attached or given as an exact path.
- “Implement the skill and also rewrite its contract.”
- “Implement `example-skill` from this approved contract artifact,” when the artifact freezes `skill.name` but omits canonical `skill.description`.
- “Implement `example-skill` from this approved contract artifact,” when the artifact requires `agents` but omits `authoring.interface`.
- “Implement `example-skill` from this approved brief,” where the brief still leaves the actual job, required outputs, or stop conditions unresolved.

Out of scope:
- “Define the contract for a new skill first.”
- “Author downstream eval suites from this finished brief.”
- “Redesign the eval/runtime architecture while implementing the skill.”

## Edge cases

- The approved contract requires only `SKILL.md` and no nearby support files: create or refactor only `SKILL.md`.
- A legacy approved contract omits `authoring.packageShape`: keep the implementation conservative and default to `SKILL.md` only.
- The approved contract explicitly requires one nearby support folder such as `references/`: add only that support folder, not a broader scaffold.
- The approved contract explicitly requires `scripts/` or `assets/`: materialize only those folders and keep the package shallow.
- The approved contract explicitly requires `agents/` and freezes `authoring.interface`: `agents/openai.yaml` is in scope for this phase.
- The approved contract explicitly requires `agents/` but omits `authoring.interface`: stop and ask instead of inventing metadata.
- The current implementation already exists but drifts from the approved contract: refactor the implementation to match the approved contract.
- The current implementation and the approved contract conflict materially: treat the approved contract artifact as authoritative for this phase and do not renegotiate the contract inside implementation.
- The approved contract artifact names the target skill correctly but omits canonical `skill.description`: stop and ask instead of inferring frontmatter metadata from the current implementation.
- The approved contract uses conditional repo authority such as “use `AGENTS.md` when present” or “consult official external docs only when materially needed”: preserve that optionality instead of rewriting it as a mandatory input.
- The approved contract uses conditional output-path rules such as “use the repo-local planning location when defined, otherwise fall back to `plans/`”: preserve that fallback behavior instead of hardcoding the fallback path as if it were always the repo default.
- Downstream eval work is mentioned but explicitly deferred: remain in implementation scope and defer that later phase.
- The task points to an exact contract file path instead of pasting the brief inline: this is valid if the file is authoritative and specific enough.
- The contract artifact exists but leaves core implementation questions unresolved: stop and ask rather than inventing the missing boundary.
